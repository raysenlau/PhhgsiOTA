Why should I use GSI for A/B devices to some A-only devices? : 
On Android 9, Google changed the requirements and all devices shipped with Android 9 must use "system-as-root".
Before this change, only A/B devices were system-as-root and GSI name was separated by A-only and A/B. 
For this historical reasons, you have to use GSI for A/B on the devices shipped with Android 9+.

Check this: ro.build.system_root_image=true
